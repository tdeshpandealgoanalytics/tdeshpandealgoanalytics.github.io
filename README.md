- The frames which are found anomalous are reported to the user in the form of alerts.
- Along with the alerts, the application also displays the anomalous images.
- Previously generated anomalies are also accessible through the application.

### Activity Tracker (Motion Heatmaps)

- Heatmaps are generated for a camera on the basis of observed motion in the feed for the specified date.
- The intensity of motion is captured and the areas with the most activity are depicted on a reference image from the same camera.

### My Alerts (Alert Customization)

- The user can customize the alerts for all the cameras.
- Rules for object detection alerts can be set and notifications can be turned on or off on the basis of the userâ€™s requirements.
